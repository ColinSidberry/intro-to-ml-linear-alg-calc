    "# Problem 5: Matrix Operations - Scaling to Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this problem, you will:\n",
    "- Understand how matrices enable batch processing of multiple examples\n",
    "- See how matrix operations scale machine learning to millions of samples\n",
    "- Explore the computational advantages of vectorized operations\n",
    "- Connect individual calculations to the linear algebra that powers modern AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **From Loops to Matrices** - Transform individual calculations into batch operations\n",
    "2. **Matrix Multiplication Deep Dive** - Understand the fundamental operation of ML\n",
    "3. **Computational Efficiency** - Compare vectorized vs loop-based approaches\n",
    "4. **Scaling to Real Datasets** - See how this enables modern deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Story Continues\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problems 1-4, you've built a complete sentiment classifier:\n",
    "- **Problem 1**: \"Go Dolphins!\" → Features `[2, 1, 1]`\n",
    "- **Problem 2**: Features + Weights → Predictions (dot products)\n",
    "- **Problem 3**: Predictions + Truth → Loss (quality measurement)\n",
    "- **Problem 4**: Loss + Gradients → Automatic optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a crucial challenge: **How do we scale this to real datasets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current approach processes one tweet at a time in Python loops. This works fine for 16 tweets, but what about:\n",
    "- **1,000 tweets** per batch?\n",
    "- **1,000,000 tweets** in a dataset?\n",
    "- **1,000,000,000 parameters** in a model like ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **matrix operations** - mathematical operations that process thousands of examples simultaneously using highly optimized linear algebra libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Matrix Operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Instead of processing examples one-by-one in loops, we organize data into matrices and use single operations to process everything at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transformation**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Slow: Loop over examples\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    prediction[i] = dot_product(features[i], weights)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fast: Single matrix operation\n",
    "predictions = features @ weights  # All 1000 predictions at once!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**:\n",
    "- **GPUs excel at parallel matrix operations**\n",
    "- **Optimized libraries** (BLAS, cuBLAS) are incredibly fast\n",
    "- **Modern deep learning** requires processing millions of parameters\n",
    "- **ChatGPT** uses this exact approach at massive scale"
